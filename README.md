How is verification processed?


You are required to join a video call which will be recorded, and in case of rug/honeypot schemes the recording would be uploaded to your social groups for the victims of scam. 


We will mark your project as verified by MGT IDO LAUNCHPAD, which will improve your trustworthiness for investors and entire crypto community.
